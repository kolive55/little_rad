# Ideas So Bad They Might Be Good?
For those fellow students and dreamers who love building things but are short on ideas, have I got some zingers for you!

Let me preface this my saying that I said "ideas", not "good ideas", and they may already exist already, but someone once said derivative can be good.

And away we go!

## T.V. Time
 Many of us gen xyz-ers are what baby boomers refer to as "cable cutters". That doesn't mean we don't watch network television, we're just watching it differently. How about a web app to build our own custom t.v. guides?

## Garbage Day
 Scrape your local public service website to find what day your recycling and garbage services occur on. Work in some Google Map magic or something too. Have a text alert the night before so you'll never be dragging those bins to the curb frantically in your undies

## Fun Facts About Amazon Users
We all love to peer into the windows of other people's houses don't we? How about pulling fun facts on user's purchasing behavior from Amazon? With the help of <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon-meta.html">this dataset</a> your voyeurism becomes guilt free!

## Playlist Sharer
Mixtapes are long dead, but that doesn't mean we should stop sharing music. Build out an app that allows you to generate a playlist for a friend. They can pop that into their streaming service of choice (Rdio, Appple Music, Google Music, Tidal(lol)) and it will generate that new palylist for them!

## Storypedia
Wikipedia is great! If you have the time to read a wall of text. See if you can scrape Wikipedia to pull out relevant content and match it images about the article. Make an internet picture book for our short attention spans/

## Bookify
Why not group books together and create custom reading lists for user based on their past books or mood or learning goals or location. You decide. Find some book data <a href="https://openlibrary.org/developers/dumps">here</a>
